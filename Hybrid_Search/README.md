## Hybrid Search Using Ensemble Retriever and Hybrid Retriever

In this project, I have implemented a hybrid search approach that combines multiple retrieval techniques to query the Llama 3 paper. 

The critical components of the approach include:

1. **Ensemble Retriever**: This component utilizes two retrieval methods:
  - **BM25**: A traditional information retrieval algorithm that ranks documents based on the relevance of their terms to the query.
  - **Dense retrieval using Sentence Transformer**: This method uses a pre-trained language model to generate dense vector representations of the query and documents, allowing for semantic similarity-based retrieval.
  - **Chroma DB**: I have used this vector database to store the vector representations generated by the Sentence Transformer. Chroma DB enables efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, which is crucial for the dense retrieval component.

2. **Weaviate Retriever**: In addition to the Ensemble Retriever, I have also incorporated the Weaviate Hybrid Search Retriever.
