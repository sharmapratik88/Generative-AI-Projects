# LearningAI - Courses from DeepLearning.AI

This section contains two specific short courses offered by DeepLearning.AI that I have completed. These courses have equipped me with the knowledge and skills to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for various AI applications.

### Courses:

1. **[ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://github.com/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI/01_ChatGPT_Prompt_Engineering_Developers)**
   1. This course, led by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng, focuses on prompt engineering best practices for application development using LLMs. 
   2. It covers summarizing, inferring, transforming text, and expanding text to build custom chatbots and other applications. 
   3. Here's the blog I wrote on this: **[Decoding ChatGPT: The Ultimate Guide to LLM Mastery](https://pratikdsharma.com/chatgpt-prompt-engineering/)**.
   4. **[Course Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)** for reference.

2. **[Building Systems with ChatGPT](https://github.com/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI/02_Building_Systems_with_OpenAI_API)** - 
   1. Taught by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng, this course teaches how to efficiently build multi-step systems using large language models. 
   2. It includes learning to split complex tasks into a pipeline of subtasks and evaluating LLM inputs and outputs for safety, accuracy, and relevance.
