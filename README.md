# Learning AI Repository

Welcome to the LearningAI GitHub repository! This repository documents my journey through the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI. It is structured into two main sections: completed courses from DeepLearning.AI and projects on NLP and Generative AI.

## DeepLearning.AI Courses

This section contains two specific short courses offered by DeepLearning.AI that I have completed. These courses have equipped me with the knowledge and skills to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for various AI applications.

### Courses:

1. **[ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://github.com/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI/01_ChatGPT_Prompt_Engineering_Developers)**
   1. This course, led by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng, focuses on prompt engineering best practices for application development using LLMs. 
   2. It covers summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding text to build custom chatbots and other applications. 
   3. I wrote the blog on this: **[Decoding ChatGPT: The Ultimate Guide to LLM Mastery](https://pratikdsharma.com/chatgpt-prompt-engineering/)**.
   4. **[Course Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)** for reference.

2. **[Building Systems with ChatGPT](https://github.com/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI/02_Building_Systems_with_OpenAI_API)** - 
   1. Taught by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng, this course teaches how to build multi-step systems efficiently using large language models. 
   2. It includes learning to split complex tasks into a pipeline of subtasks and evaluating LLM inputs and outputs for safety, accuracy, and relevance.
   3. **[Course Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/)** for reference.

## NLP and Generative AI Projects

In this section, you'll discover projects that leverage various techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI.

### Projects:

1. **[Machine Learning Using Transformers](https://nbviewer.org/github/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/blob/main/NLP_HuggingFace_LLMs/01_HF_Machine_Translation.ipynb)** - A demonstration of machine translation using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

2. **[Text Summarization Using Transformers](https://nbviewer.org/github/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/blob/main/NLP_HuggingFace_LLMs/02_HF_Text_Summarizer.ipynb)** - This project showcases text summarization capabilities using Hugging Face's Transformers. 

3. **[Text Classification Using Transformers](https://nbviewer.org/github/sharmapratik88/LearningAI/blob/main/NLP_HuggingFace_LLMs/03_HF_Text_Classification.ipynb)** - A project demonstrating how to perform text classification using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
